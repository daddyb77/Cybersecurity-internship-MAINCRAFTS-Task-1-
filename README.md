Cybersecurity Task-1

Threat Report (Awareness & Research Project)

Objective
The goal of this task is to help you understand the current landscape of cybersecurity
threats, analyze their impact, and learn how professionals present findings in the form of
threat intelligence reports.
By completing this task, you will:
• Gain awareness of modern cyber risks.
• Develop research and analytical skills.
• Learn how to present technical knowledge in a professional report format.
• Create a portfolio-ready project that you can showcase on LinkedIn or GitHub.
Task Description
You are working as a Cybersecurity Analyst Intern at a company (simulation). Your manager
has asked you to prepare a Threat Intelligence Report highlighting the latest cybersecurity
threats (2024–2025) and possible defense measures.
Your report should include:
1. Introduction to Cybersecurity
o What is Cybersecurity?
o Why is it important for individuals and businesses?
o Current relevance (cyber crimes increasing, digital dependency, AI-driven threats).
2. Identify 5 Major Modern Cyber Threats (examples you may use, or you can research
new ones):
o AI-Powered Phishing Attacks (emails, deepfakes, social engineering).
o Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) (ransomware kits available to criminals).
o Cloud Security Misconfigurations (data leaks from AWS, GCP, Azure).
o IoT Vulnerabilities (smart devices being hacked).
o Zero-Day Exploits (unpatched vulnerabilities).
3. Impact Analysis
o For each threat, explain how it can harm:
▪ Individuals (data theft, financial fraud).
▪ Organizations (loss of data, downtime, reputation damage, compliance issues).
